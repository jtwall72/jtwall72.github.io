       Git Hub Pages is pretty cool and free.</br>
       They pretty much host a static webpage and you can try stuff with it.</br>
       <hr>
       You do you have to know the basics about Git Hub though.</br>
       I can teach you if you want! :)</br>

    I am junior at NC State University majoring in Computer Science minoring in Statistics.</br>
    I am interested in data science and software.</br>
    I plan on graduating in December of 2018 or May of 2019.</br>
    I hope you have enjoyed my website.</br>
    This is also an experience of learning HTML, CSS, and maybe PHP/JS/other things so there will be a good bit of experimenting.
