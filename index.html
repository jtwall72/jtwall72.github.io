    <h2>About me</h2>
    
    <p>
    My name is James Tucker Wall. I go by Tucker. Why you might ask? I'm not sure ask my parents, I didn't really make that decision.</br>

    Currently, I am junior at <b style="color:red;">NC State University</b>, in Raleigh, North Carolina, majoring in computer science and minoring in statistics.</br>
    I am interested in data science and software.</br>

    I plan on graduating in December of 2018 or May of 2019.</br>

    Know some Spanish, French, Wolof.</br>
    Interested in learning Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek.</br></br>
    
    I am a Christian. But I am probably a lot different than the picture you have in your head of what a "Christian" is.</br></br>
    
    I have some hobbies. They include guitar, piano, snowboarding, surfing, spearfishing, Brazilian  Jui-Jistu, swimming.</br></br>
    
    I have travelled to a few different places. Belize, Guatemala, Cayman Islands, Senegal.</br>
    Here is a video that I made from Senegal called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfNsvgZKQKg">Radical Sabatical</a>.</br></br>
    
    I hope you have enjoyed my website. I started making it not too long ago. Will make changes occasionally.</br>
    This is also an experience of learning HTML, CSS, and maybe PHP/JS/other things so there will be a good bit of experimenting.
