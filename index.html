    <h2>About me</h2>
    
    <p class="cen"><br/>
    My name is James Tucker Wall. I go by Tucker. Why you might ask? I'm not sure. Ask my parents, I didn't really make that decision.<br/><br/>
    Originally, I am from Concord, North Carolina.<br/><br/>
    I have an older sister, Bailey, who is a software engineer at IXL Learning.<br/>
    My father is the director of engine engineering at Hendrick Motorsports.<br/><br/>
    Currently, I am junior at <b style="color:red;">NC State University</b>, in Raleigh, North Carolina, 
    majoring in computer science and minoring in statistics.<br/>
    I am interested in data science and software.<br/>
    Seeking an internship in data analtyics/science or software for the summer of 2018.<br/><br/>
    If you are interested in hiring me then have a look at <a href="resume.html">my r&#233sum&#233</a>.<br/><br/>

    <h2>More about me</h2>
    
    <p class="cen"><br/>
    I like and am interested in learning new languages to communicate with people.<br/>
    Natural language is English.<br/>
    Know some Spanish, French, Wolof.<br/>
    Interested in learning Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek.<br/><br/>
    
    I am a Christian. But I am probably a lot different than the picture you have in your head of what a "Christian" is.<br/><br/>
    
    My hobbies include guitar, piano, snowboarding, surfing, spearfishing, Brazilian  Jui-Jistu, swimming.<br/><br/>
    
    I have travelled to a few different places. Belize, Guatemala, Cayman Islands, and Senegal.<br/>
    Here is a video that I made from the Senegal trip called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfNsvgZKQKg">Radical Sabatical</a>.<br/><br/>
    
    I hope you have enjoyed my website. I started making it not too long ago. Will make changes occasionally.<br/>
    This is also an experience of learning HTML, CSS, and maybe PHP/JS/other web related things so there will be a good bit of experimenting.<br/><br/>
