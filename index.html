       This is a simple website that tells a little about myself for friends, employers, and fans (just kidding lol).

   <p title = "No, like seriously. I don't have fans."> This is another paragraph that has a <a href="other.html">link</a> to another page.

    Another Section</br>
    Originally I am from Concord, North Carolina. That is in the United States.</br>
    Currently, I am junior at NC State University, in Raleigh, NC, majoring in computer science minoring in statistics.</br>
    I am interested in data science and software.</br>
    Software languages that I know:
    <table>
      <tr>
          <th style="background-color:AntiqueWhite">Proficient:</th>
          <th title="This is obviously arbitrary to a degree">Java</th>
          <th>C</th>
      </tr>

        <th>HTML</th>
        <th>CSS</th>
        <th>R</th>
      </tr>
    </table>
    Languages that I plan on learning/am interesting in learning(besides the languages I am familiar with): JavaScript, C#, VB.net</br>
    Always open to learning new languages.</br>
        
    I plan on graduating in December of 2018 or May of 2019.</br>
    I hope you have enjoyed my website.</br>
    This is also an experience of learning HTML, CSS, and maybe PHP/JS/other things so there will be a good bit of experimenting.
