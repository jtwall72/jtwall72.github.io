    Other technology related things I am familiar with and can do:
    <ul style="margin:auto;">
      <li>GitHub</li>
      <li>Working/developing remotely</li>
      <li>Microsoft Office</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="cen"><br/>
    Languages that I plan on learning/am interesting in learning(besides the languages I am familiar with): JavaScript, C#, VB.net<br/>
    Always open to learning new languages.<br/><br/>
    
    Something else that I feel like is worth mentioning is my soft skills. I am good at and feel comfortable with communicating with people and would<br/>
    excel in an enviroment or position where I would be able to leverage both my soft and hard skills. <br/><br/>
